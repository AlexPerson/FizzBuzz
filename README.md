# FizzBuzz
Building a FizzBuzz game for iOS, my first TDD app in Swift.

## How to Play
Your score starts at 0 and is displayed in the upper-left button of the UI.

Each time a correct button is pressed, your score is increased by 1.

If the score after your next press is divisible by 3, press the Fizz (champagne bottle) button.

If the score after your next press is divisible by 5, press the Buzz (lightning bolt) button. 

If the score after your next press is divisible by 3 and 5, press the FizzBuzz (rocket ship) button.

If the score is NOT divisible by 3 or 5, press the button displaying your score.

Any wrong move will end the game by setting your score back to 0.
